Implemented Algorithms
======================

The algorithms currently implemented in the package can be divided in four broad groups.


Intrinsic dimension estimation
--------------------------------

These algorithms estimate the *intrinsic dimension* of the data manifold i.e., the minimum number of coordinates needed
to describe the manifold without a significant loss of information.
The algorithms currently implemented are:

* Two NN ("Two nearest neighbour estimator")
* Gride ("Generalized ratios id estimator")


Density estimation
-----------------------

These algorithms estimate the density profile from which the dataset was sampled.
The algorithms currently implemented are:

* k-NN ("k-nearest neighbours estimator")
* PAk ("Point adaptive k-NN estomator")
* k*-NN ("k-star nearest neighbours estimator")

Density based clustering
--------------------------

These algorithms find the statistically significant peaks of the density profile and use this information to divide the
dataset into clusters of data.
The algorithms currently implemented are:

* DP ("Density peaks clustering")
* ADP("Advanced density peaks clustering")

Metric space comparison
--------------------------

These algorithms estimate and quantify whether two spaces endowed with a distance measure are equivalent or not,
and whether one space is more informative than the other.
The algorithms currently implemented are:

* Neighbourhood overlap
* Information imbalance
